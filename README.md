## Data Sources
The analysis is based on publicly available data from reputable sources, including the Election Commission of India, Wikipedia, and other media sites. The specific data sources used in this analysis are listed below:

- Election Commission of India: Form 20 published by the ECI for the public used for the 2014 and 2019 election details.
- Wikipedia: The Form 20 missing data of Odisha and Chattisgarh of 2014 election. Hence, the data was scrapped from the Wikipedia pages for these states.

#### Insight: 
The vote distribution of a political party in an election does not necessarily determine the number of seats won. A party could receive a significant share of the overall vote but not secure a proportionate share of the seats.

### Voter turnout statistics

#### Insight:
Since 2014, there has been a noticeable trend of significant reductions in voter turnout in each election. Several factors may contribute to this decline. After analyzing the correlation between postal vote percentage, GDP, and literacy rate against voter turnout, no dependency was found among these variables. However, a slight positive trend was observed for postal vote percentage and literacy rate, though these correlations were too weak to draw any clear conclusions. Other potential factors, such as demographics, socio-economic conditions, politics, and the environment, also impact voter turnout.

#### Insight:
The BJP alone secured more than the majority margin of 272 seats in the 2014 and 2019 elections. In contrast, the trailing party, Congress, failed to reach the 55-seat mark required for the formation of the opposition leader. Consequently, during these periods, there was no opposition leader in the parliament. In 2024, the BJP again secured the maximum seats but failed to cross the majority margin single-handedly. On the other hand, INC made a comeback and also qualified for the formation of the opposition leader.


### Highlighting the different trends

#### Insight:
In the majority of constituencies where the same party was elected in both the 2014 and 2019 elections, the BJP was the winning party. Additionally, their vote share in the 2019 election was significant.
